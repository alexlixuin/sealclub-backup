You are given the full source code of a production-ready peptide e-commerce store.

Your objective is to rebrand and transform it into a premium skincare & wellness supplement brand while preserving all underlying functionality.

Hard Requirements (Must Not Change)

Checkout flow

Authentication & user accounts

Admin dashboard logic

Database schema & API contracts

Order, inventory, subscriptions, payments

Shipping, taxes, email flows

Functionality must remain identical.

What Must Change

1. Brand & Visual Identity

Replace all peptide-related language, imagery, product naming, and metadata

New brand tone: clean, clinical-luxury, dermatology-grade wellness

Updated color palette, typography, spacing, iconography

New homepage layout hierarchy (hero, value props, trust signals)

2. Product Layer (Data-Compatible)

Convert peptide products → skincare & wellness supplements

Preserve pricing, SKU logic, variants, subscriptions, stock handling


Constraints

Do not break types, APIs, or schemas

No feature removal

No backend refactors unless strictly required for branding

Assume the store must be deployable immediately after changes

Deliverables

Updated UI/UX

Revised copy

Rebranded assets

Product mapping (old → new)
